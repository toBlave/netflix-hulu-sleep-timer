Netflix Hulu Sleep Timer Extension for Chrome

This is simple sleep timer for use with the Netflix and Hulu site.

While Netflix has a nice feature where after a few episodes it requires user input to continue playing, Hulu Plus plays several episodes before doing the same thing.

This sleep timer is designed to take the user back to the respective netflis or hulu homepage after the set time.

This hasn't been completely tested yet. Please feel free to contribute if you think this is useful.
